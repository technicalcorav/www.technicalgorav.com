 web 2.0 submission list


So I would advise you to go to my Youtube channel there I have created algorithm video as much as I have made algorithm video you go there to see them if you have done on-page SEO on your website when you have worked on the website, go unknowingly somewhere. 


You have not had any activity so that you are not putting any penalty on Google or any search engine on your website you have to understand whether the work you have done is justified or not the according to friends of Google algorithms I can google growth here so you are saying I'm sure the algorithm is valid to all search engines if you prepare your website according to Alwar Dum.


you are likely to have traffic friends you have to watch all the videos, look carefully at all the algorithms we come to know about the algorithms we come to. What you want and then you make a submission called off-page SEO.


You first have to make a search engine submission after you create a website with algorithms in mind. When searching comes from the subject of your website, crawlers present your website there so that you have traffic.


 General Blogger seems to share his post on social media platforms while experts do search engine submissions and then make directory submissions then posting comments web 2.0 submissions, you also have to do activity in a step by step. 


It's also important to share on social media platforms.

 but unless you bring organic traffic to your website you're not going to make any profit from that website you'll have to pay attention to the backlink and domain authority on your site only if the search engine is on the site R Trust will be you keep in mind that if your posts are too small and you are also increasing DA-PA, you are less likely to get traffic, you have to do all the work step by step you do smart work.


When you sit on your system to bring traffic to the website, you don't understand what activity we do first. You write posts you start sharing posts on social media so that traffic for a short time but you're there and always traffic If you learn the submission correctly.


 you will understand what activity you have to do so that search engines restate your website to check your computer's website to see how many backlinks and domain authorities they have.


How do you need to check which website your competitor website has done off-page SEO on which website you need to go to thehoth.com and then you go to those websites and optimize if you make more submissions than your competition website, before your website  Search engine will show



This is the simple way to bring organic traffic to your website that the experts do not share their website much on WhatsApp Facebook, hiding their domain because if a blogger clicks an invalid on the expert's website, the expert will be damaged by its AdSense Account you may also keep in mind when you create a website.


create an astounding website of algorithms and complete on-page SEO then if you understand the Hindi language, you can go to my YouTube channel and watch the videos there I have algorithms.


There are also all the videos made and videos on SEO that have created you can also understand the whole process through video well if you are new, then do work only after i understand where I first understand, there are many of you who do not get the right guidance. YouTube search website traffic and the videos you see there everyone there says that you do not make a submission on it.


but nobody tells you what is right through this post I have told you the right way if you apply this method to your website, hundred cents will give you more traffic and you will earn good/



I request you not to apply to AdSense until 2000 views of the day start coming when more views come in.
